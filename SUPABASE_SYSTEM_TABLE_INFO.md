# Supabase Storage System Tables - Important Information

## Key Understanding

The `storage.objects` table is a **system table** created automatically by Supabase. You cannot:
- Create this table yourself
- Specify RLS settings during its creation
- Modify its structure
- Control its initial configuration

## What You CAN Control

### 1. Storage Buckets
You can create and configure storage buckets:
```sql
-- This works - creating buckets
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('workflow-files', 'workflow-files', true);
```

### 2. Bucket-Level Policies
You can create policies that target specific buckets:
```sql
-- This works if you have permissions
CREATE POLICY "bucket_policy" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'workflow-files');
```

### 3. Dashboard Configuration
You can modify RLS settings through the Supabase Dashboard:
- Database → Tables → storage (schema) → objects
- Toggle RLS on/off
- Create/modify policies

## The Real Issue

Since `storage.objects` is a system table with RLS enabled by default, and you don't have owner permissions to modify it via SQL, you have these options:

### Option 1: Dashboard Method (Recommended)
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Database → Tables → Find `storage.objects`
3. Disable RLS or create proper policies through the UI

### Option 2: Contact Supabase Support
If you need programmatic control over system table RLS settings

### Option 3: Use Service Role
If you have access to the service role key, you can modify system tables

### Option 4: Alternative Upload Strategy
Modify your application to handle the RLS restrictions differently

## Current Situation

Your `storage.objects` table:
- Already exists (created by Supabase)
- Has RLS enabled by default
- Requires proper policies or RLS disable to allow uploads
- Cannot be modified via regular SQL due to permission restrictions

## Immediate Solution

Since you cannot modify the system table creation, the dashboard approach remains the best solution:

1. **Dashboard → Database → Tables**
2. **Find `storage` schema → `objects` table**
3. **Disable RLS or create policies through the UI**
4. **Test uploads**

This is the standard approach for Supabase storage configuration when you don't have system-level permissions.
